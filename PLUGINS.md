# List of Plugins

Principles

- Prefer light plugin with 80% feature other than heavy plugin with 100% feature
- Plugins that have more than 1 dependencies are unacceptable
- Get rid of low priority plugins if possible

Definition of Importance

- **Essential**: Unable to have experience without it
- **High**: Significantly decrease of experience
- **Medium**: Sensible decrease of experience
- **Low**: Totally nice to have
